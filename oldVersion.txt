In mathematics and physics 
the heat equation is a parabolic partial differential equation. 
The theory of the heat equation was first developed by Joseph Fourier
for the purpose of modeling how a quantity such as heat diffuses through a
given region. Since then, the heat equation and its variants have been found to be
fundamental in many parts of both pure and applied mathematics.
